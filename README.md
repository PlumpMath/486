486 the game
=================================================================================================

[INTRO]
First, HUGE thank you for trying out "486"! Its been a labor of love and a really fun challenge
to see if I could actually do it. I started programming in QBASIC as a child, and never fully
finished a game."486" is actually based on a very simple, text-only  random integer-based 
challenge RPG I made on a TI-83 in 2003. Talk about uber n3rd.     

[GAMEPLAY]
"486" (pronounced four eighty-six) is named after the popular processors of the mid 1990s. 
It's why the tagline for the game is "play like it's 1994." I consider the game to be something
like a classic arcade-style RPG. I blend alot of gameplay elements from games I love like
Dragion Warrior, GTA, Adventure, Defender, MYST and a very old BASICA game called "Pimps Quest".   

The goal is simple: get the high score.
What makes it unique is how you go about that. You could drink at the bar to gain rep, go dance
at BEAT BEAT EVOLUTION or beat up everyone you run into. Entirely up to you.    


[CONTROLS]
Arrow keys move the player
Hitting I accesses inventory 
ESC for menu and to quit
The rest is self explanatory and indicated on screen.


[CODING]
The entire game is hand-coded in QBASIC64 and all the models 
were made in UNITY, then exported out as image sequences for QB64 to handle. It's why the game
is so big for such a simple GFX-style game! 
 
The _data folder contains all the music, sfx and gfx for the game. 
Thanks to QB64, it allows the use of referencing images, mp3s, etc which made it possible
for me to build this game! 

The SRC folder contains all the code for the game. Feel free to look through and tweak as you
wish. I only ask you credit the game and myself for the original code. And YES, it's hella
sloppy. 

[INSTRUCTIONS]
1)Unzip this folder
2)Run 486.exe


THANK YOU AND ENJOY!!
